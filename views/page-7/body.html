    <h1> Preface </h1>
    <p> On the surface writing a book may seem very different from app development — they're different trades ofcourse! — but look closely and you'll find many similarities between the two. </p>
    <p>
      For example, the former requires a masterful use of the grammatical constructs and subtle nuances of a human language (like English) to tell a story. The latter too requires exactly the same pursuit but only from someone who writes in a computer language.
    </p>

    <p> Both books and apps have design and layout challenges, and good that they have content separated from rendering. Thoughtful typography make for better consumer experience, generous usage of images and text help bring the story out. Books likely have
      a more difficult time when it comes packaging, marketing and distribution but the real difference between the two comes in the tooling that's available for each. </p>
