    <h1> Preface </h1>
    <p> On the surface book writing seems very different from app development — they're different trades after all — but at the core there are many similarities between the two. And thus a chance of one benefiting from the other. </p>
    <p> The former requires a masterful use of grammatical constructs and subtle nuances of a human language (like English), but the latter too requires exactly the same pursuit only from an author who writes in a computer language. </p>
    <p> Both books and apps have a design and layout to consider, and, thankfully both treat the idea of look and feel separate from content. Both benefit from thoughtful typography and require generous usage of text, images and style. </p>
