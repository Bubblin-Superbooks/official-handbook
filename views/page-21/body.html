    <p> Now that we have a fresh project on Bubblin, let's take a quick look at the Book Editor. </p>
    <p class="alert"> This is how it will look only with <em>blank</em> pages: </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Bubblin-Handbook/master/images/page-7/bubblin-editor-browser-frame.jpg" width="100%" />
    <p> Only one page will be highlighted in green (outlined on the right above) color suggesting that it is in active state (the ActivePage). </p>

    <p class="small"> <i class="fa fa-alert gray"> Note: </i> As of writing this page (September, 2015) there is just <a href="26" class="page">Simple HTML</a> editing mode available on Bubblin. </p>
