    <p> Now let us look at the third difference between books and apps: the database. Again on the surface it seems unlikely that books would even need a database for anything. For there is more similarity between books and static HTML websites than between books and dynamic applications with a database underneath. Until we look at workbooks and drawingbooks. </p>
    <p> I suspect that native is going to lead the way here, especially for workbooks and drawingbooks (Paper Apps?), given that we do have alternative forms of input creeping into our digital lives already. Eventually web will catch up too, adapt to the new landscape of devices, and very likely outgrow the closed gardens that it inspires and evolves from.  </p>
