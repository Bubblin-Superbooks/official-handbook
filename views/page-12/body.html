    <p> Use VCS like <span class="code">git</span> or <span class="code">svn</span> to version and save all history of your work, co-author with any number of friends — designers, content writers or developers — anywhere in the world. Cash in on _pull_requests_
      with rapid diff'ing and discussion. Seek algorithmic help on writing style, grammar and punctuation. Perform automated tests and then push to deploy with Capistrano or Chef. Ha!</p>
    <p> Compare that with what book authors have. <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html">Microsoft Word?</a>☺. The savvier ones probably have a little more than that — <span class="code">latex</span>,
      <span class="code">markdown</span> and <span class="code">lout</span> — but the tooling pretty much ends there with stripped down features limited to <strong>boldface</strong>, <em>italics</em> and rather weak formatting due to the requirement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflowable_document">reflow</a>.
      By the way did you know that reflow is no longer necessary for e-books? A little bit of inline images but even those tend to float away with reflow leaving little control with book authors. </p>
    <p> Another difference between books and apps is that books have a natural rigid spine that holds the pages (views) together. In a <em>specific</em> order or stack. It's not the same thing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinking</a>      a few loose webpages or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination"> pagination </a> in the traditional sense of web. </p>
