    <h1>Using the HEAD</h1>
    <p> Bubblin Editor interface allows for the ability to include CDN resources via the HEAD of your book. It is rather one of the best features of a Superbook.
    There are two ways to add CDN resources into the <span class="monospace">HEAD</span> of your page:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Via Superbook template, or </li>
      <li> Via page level HEAD component.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Templates are ideal for configuration of the entire book.</p>
    <p> For example, if you're writing a book on mathematics or on elementary particle physics then it's likely you're going to need Mathjax (Latex) on all of the pages. Add the MathJax library from the template HEAD.
     </p>
    <p> If the need is specific to a page then you can include that resource via page level HEAD on the Bubblin Editor.
