    <p> Following these outlines, on Bubblin we consider adding pages akin to adding one leaf at a time i.e. two sides/two pages. Click on the <span class="code"> +</span> button on the editor toolbar and it will add two fresh pages at the spot where <strong>ActivePage</strong>      had been. </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/images/add-page.jpg" width="100%" />
    <p> With <span class="code turnoff"> $ bookiza insert [page_no] </span> on the terminal, it is even easier to manage than on the browser. </p>
