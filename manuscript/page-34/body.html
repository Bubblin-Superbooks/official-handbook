    <h1> Templates </h1>
    <p> Templates are a great way to apply uniform style, js or default html on Superbooks. They're an incredibly powerful tool on Bubblin. Imagine applying a piece of code across hundreds of pages in just one click. </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/templates.jpg"

    <p> Check out some of the <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/bookiza">free templates</a> available under MIT license to style and get started on your book right away. Feel free to fork & tweak any of those themes according to your requirements. Contribute!</p>
    <p> On Bookiza projects templates can be applied inside the <span class="monospace">Templates</span>folder (go to <span class="monospace">$projectname</span> > <span class="monospace">templates/</span>) and save the template to its corresponding file.
      Bookiza will automagically pick up the contents and apply it to all the pages of your book. </p>
