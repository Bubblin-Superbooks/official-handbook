    <h1> Internal Links & Selectability</h1>
    <h4> Internal links:</h4>
    <p> Internal links of the book are handled differently from the links that lead to webpages outside the book. Use <span class="code">class="page" href="[page_no]"</span> to link to pages within the book. Checkout the HTML of the <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/blob/master/manuscript/page-7/body.html">index page</a>      of this book, for example. </p>
    <h4> Selectability</h4>
    <p> Sometimes, expecially on the desktops, people want to be able to select text on the page or inside an element. Like so: </p>
    <div class="terminal turnoff">
      $ bookiza update
    </div>
    Use <span class="turnoff code"> class="turnoff"</span> to prevent page flip and allow selectability of the text of an element. Cool!
