    <h1> JavaScript</h1>
    <p> Since a Superbook lives on the web, we can add JavaScript into the pages for fancy effects in one of the four following ways: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Via page specific HEAD loader, </li>
      <li> Via Editor Textarea for JavaScript, </li>
      <li> Via body of HTML Textarea on Editor, and</li>
      <li> Via HEAD template for the entire book.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> It is recommended to include JavaScript only on pages where it is necessary. This will lower the processing overhead of your Superbook on devices that are less powerful and improve battery performance. </p>
    <p> Restricting JS to only specific pages also helps in debugging.</p>
