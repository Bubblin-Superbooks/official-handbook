    <h1> Add pages</h1>
    <p> Adding pages on Bubblin book editor is akin to adding at least one leaf (two pages) at a time. </p>
    <p> This is done to enforce "even-ality" of book length. </p>

    <p> Click on the <span class="code"> +</span> button on the editor toolbar to add two fresh pages on the spot where <strong>activePage</strong> had been. </p>
