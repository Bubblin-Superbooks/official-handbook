    <h4> Stripe Connect </h4>
    <p> Connecting <a href="https://stripe.com/connect">Stripe</a> to your Bubblin account is easy. You must be logged in to your Bubblin account to do so. Now, if you're already writing a new book at the moment, simply hover on the <span class="code">Pricing</span> tab on the top of the editor. </p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/stripe-connect-left.jpg"

    <p> Click the <span class="code">Set up Stripe Connect</span> option and complete the process. You're going to need the following to open a new Stripe Connect account if you don't have one already: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> A bank account (routing number), </li>
      <li> A working email address,</li>
      <li> A business address.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> If you have a Stripe account simply authorize payments via Bubblin and you're all set. </p>
