        <p> Bubblin uses Stripe Connect under the hood. It is very easy to connect your Bubblin account with Stripe.</p>
        <p>First, you must be logged in to your Bubblin account to do so. Now, if you're already writing a book currently, simply hover on the <span class="code">Pricing</span> tab on the top of the editor. </p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/stripe-connect-left.jpg" width="100%" class="overlay" />
        <p> Click the Set up Stripe Connect option and complete the process at Stripe. You're all set!</p>
