    <h1> Category </h1>
    <p> Add the category of your book. Your book can belong to only one category. For example, the book on <a href="https://bubbl.in/cover/the-solar-system-by-marvin-danig">The Solar System</a> belongs to the category <span class="monospace"> Astronomy </span>.</p>
    <p>Upon submission Bubblin will approve the category of the book submitted by you. It is therefore better to use existing categories on the platform.</p>
