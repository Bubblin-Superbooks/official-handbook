    <h1> Leafs & Pages</h1>
    <p> Adding pages to a book is very easy but also a unique feature on Bubblin. Before we get into it, it is important to understand the following truth about any and every book out there: </p>
    <div class="code-block"> All books have even number of pages! </div>
    <p> No matter how thick or thin the book (or magazine) is, no matter how many leaves it has, a book will always have even number of pages. Consider this: each leaf has two sides — a front & a back — and therefore a book with 15 leafs will have 30 pages.

    <p>Likewise on Bubblin a leaf is always two-sided with an edge that binds into the spine (bifloium shown overleaf) of the superbook. </p>
