    <h1> Support Info:</h1>
    <p> All published superbooks <em>must</em> provide support information for the devices and viewports they have been tested for. Providing this information is <em>critical</em> and mandatory so that the readers can know exactly which devices they can read
      your book on. </p>
    <p> Learn more about how widespread our <a href="18" class="page">support</a> for Superbooks is on the web and how your content could be scaled correctly. </p>
