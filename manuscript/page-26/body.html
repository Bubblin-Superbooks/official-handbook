    <p> Bookiza will ask for a Github URL next. Head over to <a href="https://github.com/new">https://github.com</a> and create a new repository using the same hyphenated-name as your project's. Give a one-line description to it too.
    </p>
    <p>Leave the <span class="monospace">"Initialize this repository with a README"</span> checkbox unchecked and click on Create Repository to get a Github URL: </p>

    <p>  Copy the <span class="monospace">HTTPS url</span> from Github and provide it to Bookiza (paste) on your terminal. Ready! A barebones bookiza project is ready for some love now.  </p>
