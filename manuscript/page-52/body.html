    <h1> JavaScript</h1>
    <p> There are four ways to add JavaScript to your page: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> via per-page HEAD inserts, </li>
      <li> via textarea to hold script, </li>
      <li> via body of HTML,</li>
      <li> via HEAD /Script template.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> It is recommended to include JS only on specific pages where it is required. This would lower the processing overhead onload of your superbook into the <span class="monospace">dom</span>. It also helps in debugging when knowing exactly which page(s)
      to look into. </p>
