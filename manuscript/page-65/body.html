    <h1> Book Reviews </h1>
    <p> It's likely that Bubblin will remain free of all noise and signals of ecommerce — commentary, product reviews and opinionated responses for the reason that design language of Bubblin has been totally "designless" so far. Our focus is solely on the
      body of creation, i.e. reading & writing books. Promote a kind of silence in which books can thrive and enjoyed genuinely. </p>
    <p> Anything that relates to commerce or socializing — such as putting in reviews, adding comments — should perhaps happen elsewhere, independently, after a book has been read and needs to be written about. A word in the wild is likely more authentic
      (and counterable?) and doesn't need to sit close to the body of creation itself. </p>
