    <h1> Colophon </h1>
    <p> Colophons can be added directly into a page of the book. It is likely that no separate functionality will be provided for colophons, for not all books beg one, but there is a thought that colophons can be extracted into the <a href="54" class="page">Cover Page</a>      of a book so that writer can provide a brief statement about the publication of the book such as the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication. </p>
