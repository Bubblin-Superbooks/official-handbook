    <p> I wish web had better support for books with a <span class="code"> spine_url</span> to hold and thread pages on. A tag that considers all semantic and interaction elements of a book, especially now when the web isn't limited to desktops alone. Wouldn't
      it be nice to bring up web and books together like a single unified resource? </p>
    <p>This will require us to reconsider our assumptions about design and accessability and understand what is good for long form storytelling. But that's a discussion for another place and time. Let's look at the third and the last blurry difference between
      books and apps: a database.</p>
    <p> Again on the surface it seems unlikely that books would ever need a database for anything, for there is more similarity between books and static <span class="monospace">HTML</span> websites than between books and dynamic apps with a database underneath.
      Until we look at workbooks, drawingbooks, sketchbooks and note taking apps. </p>
    <p> I suspect that native is going to lead the way here, especially with drawingbooks (paper apps anyone?) that emulate physical paper and a pencil. Given that alternative forms of input are now closer to how we use our hands in the physical world, I
      have a gut feeling that scroll and pointy buttons will take a backseat soon. </p>
