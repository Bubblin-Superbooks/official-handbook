        It is pertinent to mention here that Bubblin doesn't consider the history of development (GIT Tree) of your story.
        It will <strong> hold</strong> and <strong> serve</strong> only the HEAD version, i.e. the last published work that was supplied to the production container (Superbook). All previous versions are OVERWRITTEN.
      </p>

        Therefore, a versioning software like GIT or SVN <em> must </em> always be used to retain history elsewhere.
