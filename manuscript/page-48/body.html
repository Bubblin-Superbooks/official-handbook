    <h1>HEAD: CDN Resources</h1>
    <p>Ability to apply and include CDN resources into your superbook is one of the best features of Bubblin. It's an outcome of bringing up <a href="https://medium.com/bubblin-superbooks/head-72e72d772a8c">web & books</a> together. </p>
    <p> There are two ways to apply CDN resources into the <span class="monospace">HEAD</span> of your page:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> via templates, or </li>
      <li> via per-page HEAD component.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Templates are an ideal way to configure the HEAD of your entire book. For example, if you're writing a book on mathematics or on elementary particle physics then it is likely that you're going to need Mathjax (Latex / Katex) on all of your pages.
      </p>
    <p> Use <a href="35" class="page">templates</a> for that. </p>
