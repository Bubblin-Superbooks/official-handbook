								<h1> Table of Contents</h1>
								<p> It is very easy and important to add a Table of Contents to your book, especially if it is really long. Table of Contents provides critical accessibility deep inside your book and helps a reader to jump from one page on your book to another easily. </p>
								<p> Table of Contents can be submitted via a textarea that accepts HTML as an unordered list alongwith a className of <span class="monospace">toc</span> like so: </p>
								<pre>
&lt;ul class="toc"&gt;
  &lt;!--- List items here ---&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; </pre>
								<p>
												Feel free to use the <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/tree/master/extras">_table_of_contents_</a> of this handbook itself (under MIT License ) to create a table of contents for your own. </p>
								<strong> Automatic Generation </strong>
								<p>Bookiza combined with the Abelone tool can generate Table of Contents automatically. Discussion about how that works is kind of out of scope for this book.</p>
