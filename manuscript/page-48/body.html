    <h1> Table of Contents</h1>
    <p> It is very easy (and important) to add a Table of Contents to your book. Cover page allows you to do that. Table of Contents improves the overall accessibility of the book and helps the reader jump from chapter to chapter easily. </p>
    <p> Table of Contents, is a textarea that accepts HTML in form of an unordered list with a class of <span class="monospace"> toc </span> attached to it. Feel free to use the <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/tree/master/extras">_table_of_contents_</a> of this book (ul.li HTML, under MIT License ) to create one for your own. </p>
		<h4> Automatic Generation of Table of Contents </h4>
		<p>Bookiza combined with the Abelone tool can generate Table of Contents automatically. Discussion about how that works is kind of out of scope for this book.</p>
