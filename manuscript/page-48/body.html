    <h1>HEAD: CDN Resources</h1>

    <p> There are two ways to apply CDN resources into the <span class="monospace">HEAD</span> of your page:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Via the HEAD template, </li>
      <li> Per page HEAD includes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Templates are an ideal way to configure the HEAD of your entire book. If you're writing a book for say higher secondary mathematics or elementary particle physics, then it is probably a good idea to configure Mathjax (Latex / Katex) as a default on
      all your pages. </p>
    <p>Paste the <span class="monospace">CDN_url</span> into the head overlay or template as show below.</p>
    <p>Note, it is mandatory to use <span class="monospace">https</span> for all resources that are included into your book.
