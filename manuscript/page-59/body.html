        <p> Setting a <span class="monospace">Price Point</span> alone does not guarantee that your book is behind a paywall. It just says that your book is <em> premium content.</em> The content itself is still open (unlocked) for anyone to read and share.</p>
        <p> Some writers prefer to take this path by leaving their paid work(s) open with a trust and hope that community will be happy to pay. To lock the content itself use the <span class="monospace">Page Marker</span>:</p>
        <h2> Page Marker: </h2>
        <p> The second pricing tool i.e. the <span class="monospace">Page Marker</span> locks down the contents of a book at the [page_number]. This allows you to sample a chapter or two from the beginning of your book and have the visitors interested in your work with more confidence. </p> 

        <p>Value on <span class="monospace">Page Marker</span> field must be an even number. All pages of the book after the <span class="monospace">Page Marker</span> are available to readers only after a purchase has been made. </p>
