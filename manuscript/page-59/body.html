        <h1> Sales model</h1>
        <p> Note that setting a price alone will not lock down your book behind a paywall. It merely says that your book is <em> priced</em> but the content is still open for anyone to read. Some writers prefer it this way and go out with a hope that some of their readers will eventually pay for their work. This sales model is suitable for those who are new in town or are feeling charitable about giving their knowledge away. </p>
        <h4> Paywall [Page marker] </h4>
        <p> The second pricing tool i.e. [page marker] will lock down the contents of your book at the page number you set. This allows you to sample a chapter or two from your book to convince the visitor and convert them by showing off a piece of your work. Setting a value on [page-marker] field will ensure that the pages after the [page-marker] are available only after a purchase has been made. </p>
