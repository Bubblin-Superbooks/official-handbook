    <h1> Sales </h1>
    <p> Bubblin provides a simple set of <a href="74" class="page">tools </a> to <strong>price and sell</strong> your work online. And a freedom unlike anywhere else.</p>
    <p> Here's a quick glance on how it works: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Set a price for your book, </li>
      <li> Decide a <a href="76" class="page">sales model</a> for it,</li>
      <li> Set a royalty -- if your wish to -- for Bubblin.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> That's it. </p> 
    <p> Your book is ready to go online and make money.  </p>
    <p> One of the biggest advantage of Bubblin here is that it lets you price your book flexibly. Unlike other e-book distribution platforms we do not influence or regulate the price of your work at any stage. It is totally up to the author to choose a competitive price at which they think their book would sell. And do well ðŸ˜‰. </p>
    <p> What more? You can of course decide to keep your book open and free for all too. Bubblin will get out of your way as quickly as it can to let your book do its thing. Choose what's best for you and for your readers. </p>
