    <h1> Sales </h1>
    <p> Sales is the final most important aspect of professional Superbooks. Bubblin provides an incredible set of tools and complete freedom to price and sell your books.</p>
    <p> The way you want it, the way it suits your readership.</p>
    <p> Here's a quick cap on our line-up: </p>
    <p> Bubblin lets you â€¦ </p>
    <ol>
      <li> decide the price of your book, </li>
      <li> decide a sales model for your book,</li>
      <li> decide the royalty, if any, to Bubblin,</li>
      <li> sell in 21 countries using <a href="https://stripe.com/connect">Stripe Connect</a>,</li>
      <li> accept payments from anywhere in the world.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The first and foremost advantage of Bubblin is that it lets you price your book. Unlike other publishers or closed off-the-web platforms, we do not recommend or regulate the price of your book at any stage. It is up to you to decide a competitive number
      at which your book would sell. </p>
