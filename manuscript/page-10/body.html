    <h1> Preface </h1>
    <p> On the surface, book writing may seem very different from app development — they are different trades after all — but at the heart of each, there is more similarity between the two than differences. For authors it is ultimately about great storytelling,
      impeccable prose, seductive design and airtight packaging. A plot to come out with a winner. </p>
    <p>Compare what a book writer does, how she progresses into her story, how she manages edits after edits of her manuscript — how a deadline must always be met — with what app developers generally do. You're in for a surprise already I'd say. A chance to look at
      how one trade could benefit from the other. </p>
    <p> Book writing requires a masterful use of grammatical constructs and subtle nuances of a human language (like English). Writing software too requires exactly the same pursuit only from an author who writes in computer language. Given that higher level
      computer languages vie for <em>human-ness</em>, convergance of the two trades eventually seems imminent. Both books and apps have a design need. Thankfully both treat design and content separately. </p>
