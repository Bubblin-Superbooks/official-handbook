    <h1> Preface </h1>
    <p> On the surface <em>book writing</em> may seem very different from app development — they are different trades after all — but at the heart of writing one, the steps of its reification are essentially the same. More or less. For authors, both of books and software, it is ultimately a run for a great story, impeccable storytelling, seductive design and perhaps skilled packaging. It's the usual wrestle to emerge a winner. </p>
    <p>Compare a day in life of a book writer with that of an app developer. How similar their habits are? How each pushes towards the goalpost slowly but steadily — how a deadline must be met! How lines after lines, pages after pages, edits after edits
      authors find cathartic meaning to their thoughts. It's almost magical to see how ideas manifest into a thing called app or a book even when there's hardly any difference between the processes of their making. </p>
    <p> Similarities are visible in every step of the way: with operative verbs like to <em>publish</em>, to <em>bump up a version</em>, to <em>add another page</em> etc. Book writers thrive on masterful use of grammatical constructs and subtle nuances of
      a human language (like English). The pursuit is to punch with an impeccable prose. </p>
