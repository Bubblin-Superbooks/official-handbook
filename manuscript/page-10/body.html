    <h1> Preface </h1>
    <p> On the surface, book writing and app development seem very different — they are different trades after all — but at the heart of creating one, be it a book or an app, the steps of their reification are the same. More or less. For authors, both of
      software and of books, it is ultimately about great storytelling, seductive design, skilled packaging and seamless delivery. A wrestle to emerge a winner. </p>
    <p>Compare a day in life of a book writer with that of an app developer. How similar their habits are? How each pushes towards the goalpost slowly but steadily — how a deadline must be met! How lines after lines, pages after pages, edits after edits
      authors find cathartic meaning to their thoughts. It's almost magical to see how ideas manifest into a thing called app or a book even when there's hardly any difference between the processes of their making. </p>
    <p> Similarities are visible in every step of the way: with operative verbs like to <em>publish</em>, to <em>bump up a version</em>, to <em>add another page</em> etc. Book writers thrive on masterful use of grammatical constructs and subtle nuances of
      a human language (like English). The pursuit is to punch with an impeccable prose. </p>
