    <h1> Author Detail </h1>
    <p> Cover page lets you add book-specific author details so that a credibility is passed on to the potential buyer. This is particularly useful when the <em>bio</em> from authors' generic profile isn't enough to present author's authority on the subject. Or when an author undertakes writing a book on a subject that's outside of their usual territory.</p>
