    <h1> Author Detail </h1>
    <p> Cover page allows authors to add book specific author-details so that author's credibility could be passed on to the potential buyer. This is particularly useful when the "bio" from the authors' generic profile isn't enough for a book or when an author
      writes something in territory that's new to them.</p>
    <p> Feature temporarily unavailable. </p>
