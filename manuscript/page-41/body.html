    <h1> Book Name & URL</h1>
    <p> The book name or the project name is built into the url of a published book. It is very easy to name a book on Bubblin. Click on <span class="monospace">Untitled</span> link on top of the editor and provide the name through overlay (Screenshot): </p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/images/book-name-url.jpg" width="100%" />
    <p> The <span class="monospace">url</span> of your book will be like so: </p>
    <div class="code-block"> https://bubbl.in/book/My-Awesome-Book-Name-by-Author-Name </div>
    <p> If you're writing the book in your local using Bookiza then the project name must be the same as the book name. </p>
