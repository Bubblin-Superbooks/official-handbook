    <h1> Commissions / Royalty</h1>
    <p> Third most important arrangement related to pricing and sales is the <strong>zero commission guarantee</strong> from the <a href="https://bubbl.in/foundation">Bubblin Foundation</a>. We are a non-profit organization and we do not take a cut from the sales/profit our authors or artists make. </p>
    <p> We rely on <a href="https://bubbl.in/foundation">grants & donations</a> instead. </p>
