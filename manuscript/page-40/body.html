    <h1> Intrinsic Design</h1>
    <p>CSS has a very important function for your book: layout. It styles the content of your book and gives it a personality. On Bubblin every page of a book is a virgin iframe you can apply CSS to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Via CSS template for the entire book, or</li>
      <li>Via page level CSS for isolated control. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Before writing your first CSS rule please take a look at Bubblin's prescribed <a href="https://bubblin.io/standards">standard</a> for Superbook layouts. Do not use heavy CSS frameworks like <span class="monospace"> bootstrap </span> or
      <span class="monospace"> normalize</span> inside, it will not work.  </p>
    <p> Refer our <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/blob/master/templates/template.css">free template</a> for intrinsic design.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Role of CSS doesn't stop with layouts. CSS can also become content itself. Take a look at our <a href="41" class="page">Sleepy Parakeet</a> on the next page that is made up entirely of CSS. </p>
