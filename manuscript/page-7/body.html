    <h1> Concept </h1>
    <p>
      Unlike e-books, a physical book is an easy product to imagine. A hard spine with a stack of pages that hold the story together. The story itself flows with a 'turn of page', an experience that also doubles up as a memory-building exercise. Memory-palace to be precise.

      This is how it works:

    <p class="small center">
      A bifolium design that compiles into a responsive book on web.
    </p>
    <p>
      A leaf, for example, has two sides—front and a back—so a book with say 15 leaves will have 30 pages to read.

        <div class="code-block center"> A Superbook always has an even number of pages. </div>
