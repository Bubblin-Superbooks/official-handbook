        <p> Similarities are evident in vocabulary of each trade as well: operative verbs like to <em>publish</em> or <em>bump up the version </em> or <em> new edition</em> or a <em>new release</em>. <em>Add a leaf or two. </em>  Choose <em> typesetting </em>, give the book/app a <em>layout</em> or <em>add some (fancy) artwork.</em> Use an <em> index</em>, <em> roll it out </em>, <em>stick to a roadmap</em>,<em> plan a campaign </em> and <em> upsell </em> and so on. </p>
        <p> Writers rely on (and thrive) on masterful use of grammatical constructs and detailing subtle nuances of a human thought with a high-level language like English or Spanish. The pursuit is almost always impeccable prose. </p>
        <p> Software writers too thrive on exactly the same parapet of acquired expertise but only in a computer language. Show-off indentation and style, defend tabs over spaces or go functional over otherwise.</p>
        <p> Given that high-level computer languages ultimately vie for <em>humanness</em> one can only imagine if a convergance of the two trades is imminent or already occurring. </p>
        <p> Both books and apps have a design need. Thus a market for designers alongside writers and developers.  The objective is to engage and perhaps 'wow the consumer.' Give it a tight layout and use some thoughtful typography. Both worlds treat the concern of design separate from content. </p>
