    <h1> Layouts </h1>
    <p>It's very easy to apply a layout to a Superbook</p>
    <p> Use the templates feature to add a layout (style) that works across the book. Occassionally, you may also need a template for HTML, JavaScript & HEAD be applied all along your book. For any of that, use the dropdown for templates… </p>
    <p> …as shown below, on the Bubblin website:</p>

    width="100%" />
    <p> On a Bookiza project layout can be added via the <span class="monospace">templates</span>folder (<span class="monospace">$ [projectname]</span> > <span class="monospace">templates/</span>) of your project.
      Bookiza will automatically apply the template to your book. Check out some free and open source<a href="https://github.com/bookiza/templates"> templates</a> on Github to get started. </p>
