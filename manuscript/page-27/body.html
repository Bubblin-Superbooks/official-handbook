    <h1> Reader mode</h1>
    <p> Bubblin is <em> optimized </em> for readers more than it is for writers. Once the book is published, it enters the READER mode, as in the Service Workers take over the live edition and manage versioning for the readers automatically on their respective devices.</p>
    <p> It is highly advised to double check and test all pages for creeping bugs and issues across multiple devices before pushing out the first version of the book. </p>
