        <h1> Pricing Tools</h1>
        <p> By default a new book is always <strong>unpriced</strong> and <strong>unmarked</strong> i.e. unlocked. When a book is published without a price or a marker all of its pages are available for anyone to read for FREE.</p>
        <p> To set a price on your book simply add <span class="monospace">book_price</span> in cents via the overlay (shown below) on pricing tab. </p>
        <p> The minimum you can sell your book for is 51ï¿ . </p>
