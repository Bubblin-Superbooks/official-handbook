        <h1> Pricing Tools</h1>
        <p> Let's take a look at pricing tools now. By default a new Superbook is <strong>unpriced</strong> and <strong>unmarked</strong> i.e. unlocked. When a book is published without a price and a marker, all of its pages are available for anyone to view & share for free.</p>
        <p> To set a price go to your book in editing mode and simply add <span class="monospace">Price Point</span> in cents (US) at which you wish to sell your book, via the overlay (shown) on the Pricing tab. </p>
        <p> The minimum value is 51ï¿ . </p>
