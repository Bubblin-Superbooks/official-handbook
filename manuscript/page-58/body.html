        <h4> Book price</h4>
        <p> By default a new book is always unpriced and unmarked. If such a book is published all of its pages will be available for anyone to read for free. To price your book simply set a <span class="monospace">book_price</span> (in cents) via the overlay shown above. </p>
        <p> The minimum you can sell your book for is 51ï¿ . </p>
