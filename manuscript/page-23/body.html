    <p> Next install <a href="https://git-scm.com/documentation">git-scm</a> to manage versioning and history of your project (book). Type the following command in your terminal. </p>
    <div class="terminal turnoff">
      <div>$ brew install git </div>
    </div>
    <p> To verify: </p>
    <div class="terminal turnoff">
      <div>$ git --version</div>
    </div>
    <p>It will say <span class="monospace">git version 2.5.1</span> or later on your console. </p>
    <p> You can also use other <span class="monospace">scm</span> tools like Mercurial, Subversion or Perforce for source code management but for the purpose of this book we'll go with Git because it is both nice and easy to work with.</p>
