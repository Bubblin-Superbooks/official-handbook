								<h1> Editor mode </h1>
								<p> The <em>in-browser</em> book editor is a simple code playground (a codemirror instance) on the Bubblin website. </p>
								<p> This is how it looks: </p>

								<p> During editing only one of the pages displayed is <em> activated </em> (show with a green outline on the right above). The highlighted page is in <strong class="code">`activeMode`</strong> and will accept changes via the code playground. </p>
