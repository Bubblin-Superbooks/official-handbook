    <p> Feel free to skip this section and move on to the <a href="22" class="page"> code playground</a> (book editor) if you're in a hurry. But if you have a kick to learn a few new things then it's recommended to go through this step right now. Will help you save the day later.  </p>

    <p> Linux users usually know about it but if you're on mac then we're going to use what is called the <span class="code">terminal</span> app. Or the bash or the shell.  </p> 
    <p> Launch the terminal (<a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line">learn how</a>) on your computer and it'll show a prompt like this: </p>
    
    <div class="terminal"> 
      ~/projects/ marvin$: <span class="prompt">_</span>
    </div>

    <p> Unfortunately, users on windows do not have access to a unix-style shell interface so you might have to install <a href="http://babun.github.io/">Babun</a> or <span class="code">cygwin</span> before the next step. </p>
