    <h1> Cover Design </h1>
    <p> Wrap your book with an interesting cover. Designing a cover on Bubblin is much simpler than it is elsewhere. You can use our own PSD <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/blob/master/assets/images/cover.psd">cover</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/blob/master/images/spine.psd">spine</a>      templates to design the top, bottom and spine of your book (available under MIT License). Also feel free to use and redistribute. </p>
    <p> Always save_image_for_the_web and optimize your PNG/JPG image using compressors like <span class="monospace">OptiPNG</span> or <span class="monospace">jpegTrans</span>. To change the cover of your book simply replace simply by reuploading a new image.
