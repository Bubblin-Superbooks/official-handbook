    <h1> Thanks</h1>
    <p> The list of people who have helped me complete this handbook alongwith the platform on which this book is hosted and the framework with which this book has been written is simply mind boggling. </p>
    <p> In no particular order I want to thank:</p>
    <p> Sonica, my wife, for making my life beautiful. All my friends in India — Nilesh, Ratan, Deepak, Niraj, Vaibhav Dhanda and Navneet, all my friends in the bay area — Mohit Gupta, John Clover, Abhishek, all my friends in Washington DC — Satie, Sameer,
      Rajat, Anisur, Ravneet, Ankit, Pooja, Anjul, Harpreet, Shweta and my new friends on the tennis court — Chandrabhan, Vikram, Niraj, Phoo, A.J. and others. I cannot have pulled this off with your support. </p>
