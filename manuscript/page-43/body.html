    <h1>Selectability</h1>
    <p> Sometimes, expecially on the desktops, people want to be able to select text of a page (or an element) without turning the page over.</p>
    <p> Like it makes sense to let people copy-paste the command below: </p>
    <div class="terminal turnoff"> $ bookiza -v </div>
    <p> Use <span class="turnoff code"> class="turnoff"</span> to prevent page flip and allow selectability of an element. Way cool, huh? </p>
