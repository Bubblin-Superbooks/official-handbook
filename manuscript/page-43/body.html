    <h1> Page Numbers</h1>
    <p> It's very easy to apply page numbers to a book. Click on <span class="monospace"> Page numbers</span> option from the <span class="monospace">Page</span> submenu as shown below.</p>

    />
    <p> This is a toggle switch so clicking again will remove page numbers from the book. </p> 
    <p> Not all books require page numbers so this switch is set at <span class="monospace">off</span> by default. Turning it on will apply page numbers at the bottom bleed of pages of the entire book.  </p>
