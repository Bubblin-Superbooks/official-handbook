    <h1> JavaScript</h1>
    <p> There are four ways to add JavaScript to your page: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> via per-page HEAD inserts, </li>
      <li> via textarea to hold script, </li>
      <li> via body of HTML,</li>
      <li> via HEAD /Script template.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> It is recommended to include JS only on specific pages where it is absolutely required. This would lower the processing overhead of your superbook when it loads into the <span class="monospace">dom</span>. </p>
    <p> Restricting use of JS specifically to pages also helps in debugging by knowing exactly where to look. </p>
