    <h1> Remove Page</h1>
    <p> While add page implies adding at least 2 pages (One leaf) into the book, removing a page removes only one page (ActivePage) at a time. </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/images/delete-page.jpg" width="100%"

    <p> This is to ensure that no other page is deleted by mistake or inadvertantly. </p>
