    <h1> JavaScript</h1>
    <p> There are four ways to add JavaScript to your page: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> via per-page HEAD inserts, </li>
      <li> via textarea to hold script, </li>
      <li> via body of HTML,</li>
      <li> via a HEAD or Script template.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> It is best to include JS only on specific pages where it is required. This lowers the processing overhead onload of the superbook into the dom. It also eases debugging when you exactly know which page(s) to look into for JavaScript. </p>
