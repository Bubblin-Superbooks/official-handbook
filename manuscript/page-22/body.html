    <h1> Layouts </h1>
    <p> Templates are an excellent way to apply a layout (style)  all across a book. But then style isn't everything. Sometimes you also need a template for HTML, JavaScript & HEAD to use all along of your book.  </p>
    <p> On Bubblin website:</p>

    <img class="overlay" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/templates.jpg"
    width="100%" />
    <p> On Bookiza, layout files can be placed in the <span class="monospace">templates</span>folder (<span class="monospace">$ [projectname]</span> > <span class="monospace">templates/</span>) of your project.
      Bookiza will automagically pick up the contents and apply it to all the pages of your book. </p>
    <p> Check out some <a href="https://github.com/bookiza/templates">free templates</a> on Github to get started. </p><p> Contributions are welcome!</p>
