        <p> In fact as you'll soon learn that much of our principles of good design and processes for app development are also valid for books. Professional book writers like app-developers prefer to save history of all their work. Keep track of their progress. In fact manuscript editions are like software builds (versions) with only subtle changes that the authors makes with experience. So is there a difference at all? </p>
        <p> Through my role at Bubblin, switching hats between that of a book writer and an app developer, I've come to realize that at an operational level there are only three noteworthy differences, which too kind of blur away as we step closer to a world of book writers who also create apps. </p>
        <p> The main differences between book making and app making are: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> The tool chain, </li>
            <li> The spine that stems pagination, and </li>
            <li> Probably a database. </li>
        </ol>
