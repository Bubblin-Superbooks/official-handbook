        <h1> Prologue </h1>
        <p> On the surface book-writing may seem <em> different </em> from app development — they are different trades after all — but at the heart of each, in the steps of their reification, they are one and the same. There is no difference at all! For authors of both books and apps it is ultimately a run towards a great story. A seductive design, engagement within, a skilled packaging and an impeccable launch. </p>
        <p>It is the usual wrestle to emerge a <em>winner</em>. </p>
        <p>Comparing a day in the life of an author with that of an app developer we can quickly arrive at how similar their habits too are. Each pushes towards a goalpost next day, struggles to tread fast but can move on so fast — and yet how a deadline must be met! Grammar, syntax and the logic of the story. </p>
        <p> Line by line, edit after edit, page by page authors find a cathartic meaning to their story. Same thing happens with the developers. Line by line, fix after fix, (web)page by (web)page we move forward towards the end goal. </p> <p>It's magical. </p>
