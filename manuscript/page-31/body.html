    <h1> Page Numbers</h1>
    <p> It's very easy to add page numbers to a book. Click on the <span class="monospace"> Page numbers</span> option from the <span class="monospace">Page</span> submenu as shown below and select the checkbox.</p>

    <p> Uncheck to remove the page numbers from the book. </p>
    <p> Not all books (like comics or photobooks) need page numbers, so this switch is handy to turn page_numbers on or off as it may be necessary. Page numbers are displayed at the top corners of the book as a standard. </p>

    <p> This cannot be customized. </p>
