    <p> The idea of spine isn't supported (or proposed) yet and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinking</a> a few loose pages or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination"> pagination </a> in the traditional sense of web
      isn't the same thing. Spine not only makes for a linear reading experience it also piecemeals the content into small chewable chunks that feel particularly great on mobile and tablets. </p>
    <p> Ten years ago people tried emulating book with page-flips using third-party plugins like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Macromedia Flash</a>. But those attempts were crude and the experience far from ideal. It felt particularly
      bad at a time when web was desktop-only and the desktops were a lot less powerful. Scroll felt better than clicking through hundreds of pages using a mouse pointer. </p>
    <p> A major reason why ebooks never made it big on the web unlike YouTube videos — which ironically used(s) the same underlying flash technology — is that page-flipping required the users to click too many times to move through the book. That's painful,
      not just bad design. </p>
    <p> In many ways flash undid the cause of books on the web. It left such a bad aftertaste that many authors chose to ripping their books apart and turning them into plain (even ugly) websites; often ending up with poor readership and lower than expected
      sales. </p>
