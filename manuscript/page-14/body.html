    <p> Now let us look at the third difference between books and apps: a database. Again on the surface it seems unlikely that books would ever need a database for anything. For there is more similarity between books and static <span class="monospace">html</span>      websites than between books and dynamic applications with a database underneath. Until we start looking at workbooks and drawingbooks. </p>
    <p> I suspect that native is going to lead the way here, especially with drawingbooks (Paper apps?) that emulate paper and pencil. Given that alternative forms of input are now closer to how we write and draw in physical world, I have a gut feeling that
      scroll will die soon. Eventually, web will catch up and adapt to the new landscape of devices, and very likely outrun the closed gardens that it inspires and evolves from. </p>
