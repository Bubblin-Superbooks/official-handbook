    <h1> Pricing Tools</h1>
    <p> Once Stripe is connected to your Bubblin Account you'll see the following three options on the <span class="code">Pricing</span> tab:</p> <img src="//raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/images/pricing-tools.jpg" width="100%"
    />
    <p> Note, all transactions will be in US dollars only. </p>
    <h4> Book price</h4>
    <p> By default a new book is always unpriced and unmarked. If such a book is published all of its pages will be available for anyone to read for free. To price your book simply set a <span class="monospace">book_price</span> (in cents) via the overlay.
      The minimum you can sell your book for is 51ï¿ . </p>
    <p> Note that setting a price doesn't lock down your book behind a paywall. It merely says that your book is priced. This means that you can price a book and still keep it open for everyone to read. In a hope that some of those readers will eventually
      pay you for the work. </p>
