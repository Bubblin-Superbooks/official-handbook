    <p> Bubblin provides a simple set of tools to <a href="74" class="page">price</a> and sell your books online. And a freedom unlike anywhere else.</p>
    <p> Here's a quick glance on how it works: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Set the price of your book, </li>
      <li> Decide a <a href="76" class="page">sales model</a> for yourself,</li>
      <li> Set a royalty, if any, to Bubblin.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> That's it. Your book is ready to sell online. </p>
    <p>The biggest advantage of Bubblin is that it lets you price your book flexibly. Unlike other e-book distribution platforms, we do not regulate or influence the price of your book at any stage. It is totally up to the author to choose a competitive
      number at which he / she thinks their book would sell, and do well. </p>
    <p> The second advantage is that you can choose to keep your book open for anyone to read or give it away for free if you are feeling generous. Bubblin will let you choose a sales model for your book and do what is appropriate for your readers. </p>
