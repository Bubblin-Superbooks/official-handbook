    <h1> Pricing Tools</h1>
    <p> Once Stripe Connect is integrated with your Bubblin Account, you'll see the following three vectors to help you choose a price and a sales model for your superbook:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Price in cents </li>
      <li> Page marker </li>
      <li> Commission (Optional) </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Note, all transactions are in US dollars only. And Stripe is currently available only in the following <a href="https://stripe.com/global">countries</a>. </p>
    <h4> Setting a price</h4>
    <p> will automatically convert the cents into dollars for your book. The minimum price you can set for your book is 51ï¿ , or leave it without a numeric price i.e a free book. </p>
    <p> Setting a price or not setting one gives you two kinds of books to publish. A free book or a priced but open book. </p>
