        <p>Inside each <span class="monospace">page</span> folder you'll find the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><span class="monospace"> body.html </span></li>
          <li><span class="monospace"> style.css </span></li>
        </ol>
        <p> Sometimes there will also be a script and a head compment inside a page. Like so: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> <span class="monospace"> script.js </span> </li>
          <li> <span class="monospace"> head.html </span></li>
        </ol>
        <p> For example, the page on the right uses all four. </p>
