      Linux users or developers usually know about this but if you're on Mac then we're going to use what is called the <span class="code">terminal</span> app, or the bash, or the shell to get started.

    <p>
      Learn (<a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line">how to use a terminal.</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      On the terminal, you'll see a prompt:
    </p>
    <div class="terminal"> ~/projects/ marvin$: <span class="prompt">_</span> </div>
    <p>
      The prompt is where you're going to type in or copy-paste the following <em>commands</em> to complete installation. That's why the name 'command-line' or console. ;-)

    <p> Unfortunately, users on windows do not have access to a unix-style shell interface. You'll have to install <a href="http://babun.github.io/">Babun</a> or <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847837.aspx">Powershell</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder">Cmder</a>      or <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> and come back to this page later with a running terminal on your computer. </p>
