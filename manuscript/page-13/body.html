    <p> And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinking</a> a few loose pages or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination"> pagination </a> in the traditional sense isn't
      the same thing. Spine restricts the arrangement on the stack and makes for linear reading experience. I found it particularly nice to read piecemealed content on mobile and tablets with page-flip. The spine broke down the content into small chewable
      chunks that were easier to remember. </p>
    <p> About ten years ago people tried emulating the book with third-party plugins like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Macromedia Flash</a>, but those attempts were crude. The experience far from ideal, especially, when web was desktop-only. In my opinion flash undid the cause of books more than anything else. It left a bad aftertaste, so much so that many of us chose to ripping apart our books at the spine and turning them into websites. Ending up here, with a bad choice of design and often poor relationship with book lovers on the web.

    <p> I wish web had better support for books with a <span class="code"> spine_url</span> to host and thread pages on. A tag that considered all semantics and pragmatics of a book and its subresources. Like pages, cover, colophon etc. Only then could web
      catch up with what's truly a book reading experience. Go beyond the scroll, but that's a discussion for another place and time. </p>
