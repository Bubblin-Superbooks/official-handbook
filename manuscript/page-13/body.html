    <p> the idea of spine isn't supported (or proposed) yet. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinking</a> a few loose pages or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination"> pagination </a> in the traditional sense isn't
      the same thing. Spine restricts the arrangement on the stack and makes for a linear reading experience. I found it particularly nice to read piecemealed content on mobile and tablets with page-flip. The spine broke down the content into small chewable
      chunks that were easier to remember. </p>
    <p> About ten years ago people tried emulating book spine with third-party plugins like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Macromedia Flash</a> but those attempts were rather crude. The inferior experience was particularly bad on desktops
      and it seems to have done more damage to the cause of books than good. Its bad taste led many to rip their books apart at the spine and turn them into websites, often ending up with bad design and poor readership. </p>
    <p> I wish web had better support for books with a <span class="code"> spine_url</span> to host and thread pages on. A tag that considered all semantics and pragmatics of a book and its subresources i.e. pages, cover, colophon etc. Only then could web
      catch up with what's truly a book reading experience that's good for both readers and writers. But that's a discussion for another place and time.</p>
