    <h1> Device Support</h1>
    <p> A blank superbook is suppoted on <em>all</em> devices (all viewports) and all desktops (all operating systems) with a <a href="http://browsehappy.com/">modern browser</a>. It is only the content that would eventually limit the outreach of your book. </p>
    <p> For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">webgl</a> may not be supported on some devices and older desktops. If your book uses <span class="code">webgl</span>, then it will certainly not be available on those devices. Use <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/blob/master/views/page-11/style.css">responsive typography</a>      for text and images to compose the pages of your book. </p>
    <p> Always test your content i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript on multiple devices and look for support and known issues on <a href="http://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a>. Else you'll risk supporting fewer devices than you possibly could.</p>
