    <h1> Device Support</h1>
    <p> A blank superbook is <a href="https://bubbl.in/support">supported</a> on all devices and all desktops (all viewports & operating systems) with a modern browser. </p>
    <div class="center"> <img width="60%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/images/browsericons.png" /> </div>
    <p> It is only the content that could limit the outreach of your book. For example, <span class="monospace">webgl</span> may not be supported on some older devices and desktops. If your book uses <span class="monospace">webgl</span>, then it will not
      be available on those devices.
      <p> Always test your content thoroughly using multiple devices. Use <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/templates/template.css">responsive typography</a> for text and images, else you'll risk supporting fewer
        devices than you could.</p>
      <p class="small"> <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up gray"> Pro tip: </i> Provide support information on the cover page of your book. Refer <a href="http://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a> for HTML5 & CSS3 support and coverage. </p>
