    <p> Making money off your work is an important goal of Bubblin. We provide a simple set of <a href="74" class="page">tools </a> to <strong>price and sell</strong> your book easily. With a freedom unlike anywhere else.</p>
    <p> There are three steps to follow: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Choose a price for your book, </li>
      <li> Decide a <a href="74" class="page">sales model</a>,</li>
      <li> Set a royalty (or none) for Bubblin (<a href="75" class="page">learn more</a>).</li>
    </ol>
    <p> â€¦ and publish! </p>
    <p> One of the biggest advantage of Bubblin here is that we let you choose a price for your book flexibly. While we encourage people to keep their books free forever our influence does not extend beyond that. It is totally up to the creator to choose a competitive price at which their book would sell. And do well ðŸ˜‰. </p>
