    <h1> Add Pages</h1>
    <p> Adding pages to a book is very easy but also unique on Bubblin. Before we get into that it is important to understand the following that is true for any and every book out there: </p>
    <div class="code-block"> All books have even number of pages! </div>
    <p> No matter how thick or thin the book (or magazine) is, no matter how many leaves it has, a book will always have even number of pages. Consider this: each leaf has two sides — a front & a back — and therefore a book with 15 leafs will have 30 pages.

    <p>On Bubblin the leaves are also responsively folded into a bifolium, with an edge that binds into the spine (shown overleaf) of the superbook. </p>
