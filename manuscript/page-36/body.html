    <h1> Fullbleed Images </h1>
    <p> One of the most powerful features of Superbooks is its ability to display fullbleed imagery. You can also apply <a href="46" class="page">special effects</a> to your image.</p>
    <p> To make sure your image (jpg/png) scales and behaves responsively, use  the following dimensions: </p>
    <div class="code-block">1115 pixel X 1443 pixels </div>
    <p> and apply it like a <span class="code">css background</span> using the following adaptive & responsive <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/manuscript/page-45/style.css"> CSS template</a>. Done! </p> <p> Fullbleed imagery is particularly
      useful for sports, lifestyle or fashion magazines. It can also be used for science or nature journals and webcomics. </p>
