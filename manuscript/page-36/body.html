    <h1> Add / Remove Pages</h1>
    <p> Adding pages to a book on Bubblin is very easy but a unique concept. It is important to understand something here that is true for any book out there: </p>
    <p> All books have even number of pages. </p>
    <p> No matter how thick or thin the book (or magazine) is, no matter how many leaves it has, a book will always have even number of pages. Consider this: each leaf has two sides — front & back — and therefore a book with say 15 leaves will have 30 pages,
      counting both sides in. </p>

    <p>Leaves are also generally folded into a bifolium, with an edge that binds to the spine (shown overleaf) of the book. On Bubblin we consider adding pages akin to adding one leaf at a time i.e. two sides/pages. </p>
