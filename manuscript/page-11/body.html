    <p>Book authors stand to gain as much from thoughtful typography as app developers do for their apps. Professional book writers, like app developers, prefer to
      save all history of their work. Keep track of their progress. In fact manuscript editions are so much like software builds with only subtle changes that an author makes from experience and learnings. </p>
    <p> But at a high level is there a difference? Through my role at Bubblin, switching hats between that of a book writer and an app developer, I've come to realize that there are only three fundamental differences between books and apps (both websites & native): </p>
    <ol>
      <li> The tool chain, </li>
      <li> A spine that stems pagination, and </li>
      <li> Probably a database. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> A major difference between the two products is in the tools of their making. The choice of tools and tackles at disposal of developers is simply outrageous. It is obvious that apps have been in vogue for much of the past two decades and there is goldrush in providing whatever  developers need. Use <span class="code">vim</span> or <span class="code">emacs</span> if you like the terminal or soak in Sublime or Atom if you prefer a sophisticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor">text editor</a>.
