    <h1> Responsible CSS3</h1>
    <p>You can apply CSS in two different ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>via a template for the entire book, or</li>
      <li>with per-page CSS for finer control. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Before writing your first style rule please understand that all books must be responsive & adaptive as per Bubblin's prescribed <a href="https://bubbl.in/standards">standards</a>. Do not just blindly add <span class="monospace"> reset</span>/
      <span class="monospace"> normalize</span> css or try to emulate layout of a physical book/magazine on the web.  </p>
    <p> Refer our <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/blob/master/templates/template.css">free template</a> to help you get started on valid viewport-specific responses for your CSS.</p>

    <p>CSS has an important function for your book. It styles the content of your book and gives it a personality. But the role of CSS doesn't stop there. CSS can also become the content itself. Like it did with our <a href="6" class="page">sleepy parrot</a> earlier. </p> <p> Our founders believe that CSS-only comics are a trend waiting to happen. Tailored just for the web. </p>
