    <h1> Responsible CSS3</h1>
    <p>On Bubblin you can apply CSS to your books in two ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>via template for entire book, or</li>
      <li>with per-page CSS for finer control. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Before setting to write your first CSS rule, understand that all books must be responsive and scalable as per Bubblin's desired <a href="https://bubbl.in/standards">standards</a> for Superbooks. Don't just blindly include <span class="monospace"> reset.css / normalize.css </span>      when you're not going to use more than half of its rules. </p>
    <p> Refer free <a href="">templates</a> to help you get started.</p>

    <p>CSS is an important aspect of your book. It styles the content and gives your book a personality. Not only that, CSS can also become the content itself. Like with our <a href="6" class="page">sleepy parrot</a> to wake you up to CSS3.</p>
