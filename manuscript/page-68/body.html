    <h4> Setup </h4>
    <p> Let's get to setting up <a href="https://stripe.com/connect">Stripe</a> first. You must be logged in to your Bubblin account to intgerate payments. If you are writing/editing a new book simply hover on the <span class="monospace">Pricing</span> tab
      on the top of your book (See screengrab below). </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/images/stripe-connect-left.jpg" width="100%" />
    <p> Click through <span class="code">Setup Stripe Connect</span> option to initiate integration. If you already have a Stripe Account simply login and authorize access to Bubblin. You're all set. </p>
    <p> If you're new to Stripe then you're going to need the following pieces to complete your setup: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> A bank account (with routing number) </li>
      <li> A working email address</li>
      <li> A business address</li>
    </ol>
    <p> You'll see a signup form from Stripe (see overleaf). </p>
