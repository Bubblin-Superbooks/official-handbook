    <p> Use VCS like <span class="code">git</span> or <span class="code">svn</span> to version and save all history of your work and co-author with any number of friends — designers, content writers or developers — anywhere in the world. Cash in on pull_requests
      with rapid diff'ing and discussion. Seek algorithmic help on code quality and perform automated tests. Push to deploy with Capistrano. Ha!</p>
