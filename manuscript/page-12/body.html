    <p> The main differences between book making and app making are: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> The tool chain, </li>
      <li> The spine that stems pagination, and </li>
      <li> Probably a database. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> A major difference between books and app is in the tools of their making. The choice of tools and tackles at disposal of developers is simply outrageous. It is obvious that apps have been in vogue for much of the past two decades and there is goldrush
      in providing whatever the developers need to create apps. </p>
    <p> Use <span class="code">vim</span> or <span class="code">emacs</span> if you like the terminal or soak in Sublime or Atom if you prefer a sophisticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor">text editor</a>. Use a VCS like <span class="code">git</span>      or <span class="code">svn</span> to version all history of work and co-author with any number of friends — designers, content writers or developers — anywhere in the world. </p>
