    <h1> Bash Your Book</h1>
    <p> Feel free to skip this section and go to the <a href="22" class="page">code playground</a> (book editor) if you're in a hurry to write your book. But if you have a little time and kick to learn then recommend to first install and setup the <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/bookiza">Bookiza Framework</a>.
      </p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> This will take about 30 minutes.</p>
    <p> Linux users usually know about it but if you're on mac then we're going to use what is called the <span class="code">terminal</span> app. Or the bash, or the shell. Launch the terminal (<a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line">learn how</a>),
      you'll see a prompt like this: </p>
    <div class="terminal"> ~/projects/ marvin$: <span class="prompt">_</span> </div>
    <p> The prompt is where you're going to type in / paste the commands to complete the setup. Hence, the name command-line or console. </p>
    <p> Unfortunately, users on windows do not have access to a unix-style shell interface. You'll have to install <a href="http://babun.github.io/">Babun</a> or <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847837.aspx">Powershell</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder">Cmder</a>      or <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> and come back to this page later with a terminal console on your computer. </p>
