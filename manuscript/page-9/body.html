    <h1> Device Support</h1>
    <p> A blank Superbook is <a href="https://bubbl.in/support">supported</a> on all devices, all viewports and all desktops (all operating systems) sporting a modern browser. </p>
    <div class="center"> <img width="60%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/browsericons.png" /> </div>
    <p> It is only the content (underlying CSS or frontmatter) that could limit the outreach of your book. For example, <span class="monospace">webgl</span> may not be supported on some of the older devices or desktops. If your book uses <span class="monospace">webgl</span>, then it will not
      be available on those devices.
      <p class="small"> <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up gray"> Pro tip: </i> Use <em>viewport units</em> (CSS) for responsive typography like the one described on this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/templates/template.css">template</a> to support as many devices as possible.</p>
      <p class="small"> <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up gray"> Pro tip: </i> Refer <a href="http://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a> for support of HTML5 & CSS3 features to provide appropriate information on the <a href="49" class="page">cover page</a> of your book.  </p>
