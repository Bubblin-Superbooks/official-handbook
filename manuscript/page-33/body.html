    <p> Let's step back a little and take a look at the <em>in-browser</em> book editor — i.e. the Code Playground — on Bubblin. </p>
    <p> Below is a screenshot: </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/bubblin-editor-browser-frame.jpg" width="100%" />
    <p> In the editing mode only one of the pages of the book is <em> highlighted</em> outlined in green color (see above). The highlighted page is in <strong>ActiveMode</strong> and is available for live editing through the code playground. </p>
