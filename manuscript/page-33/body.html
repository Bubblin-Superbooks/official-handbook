    <h1> Reader's mode</h1>
    <p> Bubblin is <em> optimized </em> for readers more than the writers.</p>
    <p> For example, it has only one editing mode on site: </p>
    <p class="code-block "> HTML + CSS + JavaScript </p>
    <p> It is important to understand here that Bubblin doesn't care about the history of your manuscript. It doesn't save editing history or older versions of your book. It only keeps and hosts the latest i.e. last submitted / edited manuscript that is supplied to the production container either via the code playground or bookiza. </p> 
    <p> You <em> must </em> use versioning software like GIT or SVN to maintain history of your work/manuscript elsewhere. </p>
