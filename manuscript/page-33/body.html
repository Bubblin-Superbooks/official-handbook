    <h1> Internal Links</h1>
    <p> Internal links of the book are handled differently from the links that lead to webpages outside the book.</p>
    <p> Use <span class="turnoff code">class="page"</span> with <span class="turnoff code">href="[page_no]"</span> like so: </p>
    <div class="code-block"> class="page" href="20" </div>
    <p>to link to page number <span class="monospace">20</span> of the book. </p>
    <p> Checkout the HTML of the <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/blob/master/manuscript/page-7/body.html">index page</a> of this book, for example. Internal linking is a cool way to connect pages of a book that is already loaded in the
      dom. </p>
    <p>It is mandatory to use Bubblin's <a href="https://bubbl.in/standards">Internal Linking API</a> when connecting to pages within the book.</p>
