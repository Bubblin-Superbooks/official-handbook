  tools so that it's easy to keep foot on the gas pedal just that long. This handbook is a friend that helps you always learn. In solitude it will rise and help you cross the river. Use everything that's within the power of the web to give shape to your
  thoughts. </p>

<p> It is a progressive, living and free-to-read resource with great focus on elements of writing responsive superbooks. It is a gentle tug to the <em> technical temper </em> within each one of us. Even the writers who haven't seen or written code in their
