        <h1> Note of Thanks</h1>
        <p> The list of people who have helped me write this book, write code for the platform on which this book is hosted (<a href="https://bubbl.in">https://bubbl.in</a>) and the code of the framework with which this book has been created (<a href="http://bookiza.io">http://bookiza.io</a>) is simply mind boggling. </p>
        <p> In no particular order (I'm lying here) I want to thank:</p>
        <p> Sonica, my wife, for making my life beautiful. All my friends in India — Nilesh, Ratan, Deepak, Niraj, Vaibhav Dhanda and Navneet, all my friends in the bay area — Mohit Gupta, John Clover, Abhishek, all my friends in Washington DC — Satie, Sameer, Rajat, Anisur, Ravneet, Ankit, Pooja, Anjul, Harpreet, Shweta and my new friends on the tennis court — Chandrabhan, Vikram, Niraj, Phoo, A.J. and others. I cannot have pulled this off with your support. </p>
        <p>A very special thanks to Manish and family in California, particularly to Sanvi, Svana & Anshu. </p>
