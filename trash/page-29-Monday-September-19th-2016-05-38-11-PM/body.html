    <p> It quickly provides all the project defaults and gives a structure to our manuscript so that we can focus on writing our book. For the most part, we'll be working inside the <span class="monospace">manuscript/</span> folder of the project. That's
      where all of our <span class="code">content / code</span> would go. </p>
    <p> Inside the <span class="monospace">manuscript/</span> there are pages of the book. Since Bubblin uses web as the default medium for its books, our manuscript is essentially a sum of only three components: HTML, CSS & JavaScript, i.e the building blocks of web.
      <p>
        <p>Inside each <span class="monospace">page-[Number]</span> folder you'll find the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><span class="monospace"> body.html </span></li>
          <li><span class="monospace"> style.css </span></li>
        </ol>
        <p> Sometimes there will also be a script and a head compoment inside a page. Like so: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> <span class="monospace"> script.js </span> </li>
          <li> <span class="monospace"> head.html </span></li>
        </ol>
        <p> For example, the <a href="https://github.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/tree/master/manuscript/page-31">page on the right</a> uses all four. </p>
