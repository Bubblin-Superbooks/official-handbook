In fact there is hardly any difference at all! For writers, of both books or software, it is ultimately the same run towards getting to a great story, a seductive design, engagement, skilled packaging and an impeccable launch. </p>
        <p>A magical product. </p>
        <p>Comparing a day in life of an author with that of a developer we can quickly arrive at how closely their life traits are related and how tooling for one leaves a lot to ask for while for the other it is just too much to take in. Each trade offers a wide selection of opportunities, a set of daring  challenges and a series of goalposts that must be must be met. </p>
        <p> Line by line, edit after edit both software writers and book authors try to find a cathartic meaning to their lives—or simply earn money or to add to their careers. Both products undergo distribution challenges to their creators and lean on professional help on the project. </p>
